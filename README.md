# Fair Beam Allocations through Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces,” IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications
## Description
The main file is main.m, which includes beam visualization with explicit beamforming algorithm implementation. 
The TestBeam1234.m file contains the implementation code for performance comparison of other methods (primarily Fminimax, QuantRand, and SDR-SDP) with the proposed MA method.
